# Configuration

The configuration file can be found at `/etc/pihole/pihole.toml`, all of the options are documented within this file.

The file can be edited directly, however you can also use the command line option (`pihole-FTL --config`) or the web interface.

There is also an outline of the configuration options in the [api documentation](../api/index.md#accessing-the-api-documentation).

## Pi-hole configuration file example - `pihole.toml`:

```toml
--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pi-hole/FTL/refs/heads/master/test/pihole.toml"
```
