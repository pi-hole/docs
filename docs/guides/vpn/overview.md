>This tutorial is tailored for setting up OpenVPN on a cloud-hosted virtual server (such as [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=344d234950e1)). If you wish to have this working on your home network, you will need to tailor Pi-hole to listen on `eth0` (or similar), which we explain in [this section of the tutorial](dual-operation.md).

### High-level Overview

Using a VPN is a responsible, respectful, and safe way to access your Pi-hole's capabilities remotely. Setting up a DNS server has become a simple task with Pi-hole's automated installer, which has resulted in many people knowingly--or unknowingly--creating an open resolver, which aids in DNS Amplification Attacks.

We do not encourage open resolvers but there are always people wanting access to their ad-blocking capabilities outside of their home network, whether it's on their cellular network or on an unsecured wireless network. This article aims to provide a step-by-step walk-through on setting up a server running Pi-hole and OpenVPN so you can connect to your Pi-hole's DNS from anywhere. This guide should work for a private server installed on your private network, but it will also work for cloud servers, such as those created on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=344d234950e1).

**This tutorial walks you through the installation of Pi-hole combined with a VPN server for secure access from remote clients**.

Via this VPN, you can:

- use the DNS server and full filtering capabilities of your Pi-hole from everywhere around the globe
- access your admin interface remotely
- encrypt your Internet traffic

If you don't want a full-tunnel, we provide a wiki of how to [set up your server to exclusively route DNS traffic, but nothing else via the VPN](only-dns-via-vpn.md). On another optional page, we describe how to set up Pi-hole + VPN in such a way that it is [usable both locally (no VPN) and from remote (through VPN)](dual-operation.md) while preserving full functionality.

In the end, you will have access to a VPN that uses Pi-hole for DNS and tunnels some or all of your network traffic
