### Optional: Only route DNS via VPN

With this setup, you will force connected clients to use **only the DNS provided by the VPN connection, i.e. the Pi-hole.**  Do this only if you **don't** want to tunnel all traffic from the client through the VPN, but only its DNS queries.

Edit your `/etc/openvpn/server/server.conf` and remove (comment out) the following line:

```ini
# push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
```

### Using a client config file

This works pretty much out of the box with common `client.ovpn` files, like this provided one: [client.ovpn](client.ovpn)

Remember to replace the locations of your keys and the address/hostname of your server.

### Using the Network Manager

When using the Network Manager, you will have to do some additional setting on the client's side of things:

#### Alternative 1: Disable Network Manager's internal DNS server

Edit `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`:

```ini
# dns=dnsmasq
```

and restart the Network Manager:

```bash
sudo restart network-manager
```

When connecting your DNS server will now be properly picked up and used by your client.

#### Alternative 2: Set DNS server address of your Pi-hole manually on the main interface

You can also set the address of the DNS server manually (use the device which actually connects to the internet, e.g. `eth0`):

After doing either alternative, you should see:

```text
pi.hole has address W.X.Y.Z (outside address of your VPN server)
pi.hole has IPv6 address A:B:C:D:E:F (outside address of your VPN server)
```

The web interface of your Pi-hole will be visible at `http://pi.hole/admin/` (even with the recommended firewall configuration mentioned on another subpage)

## Troubleshooting

If your new DNS server configuration has not been activated (try restarting the interface/system) you will see

```text
host pi.hole
Host pi.hole not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
```

If you are not connected to your VPN network you will see

```text
host pi.hole
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
```
