# Sample client-side OpenVPN 2.0 config file #
# for connecting to Pi-hole OpenVPN server.  #
#                                            #
# This configuration can be used by multiple #
# clients, however each client should have   #
# its own cert and key files.                #

# Specify that we are a client and that we
# will be pulling certain config file directives
# from the server.

# Are we connecting to a TCP or
# UDP server?  Use the same setting as
# on the server.

# The hostname/IP and port of the server.
# You can have multiple remote entries
# to load balance between the servers.
remote <<<<<my.ip.address.here>>>> 1194

# Keep trying indefinitely to resolve the
# host name of the OpenVPN server. Very useful
# on machines which are not permanently connected
# to the internet such as laptops.

# Most clients don't need to bind to
# a specific local port number.

# Try to preserve some state across restarts.

# SSL/TLS parms.
# See the server config file for more
# description.  It's best to use
# a separate .crt/.key file pair
# for each client.  A single ca
# file can be used for all clients.
ca /home/dl6er/openvpn/ca.crt
cert /home/dl6er/openvpn/client.crt
key /home/dl6er/openvpn/client.key

# Verify server certificate by checking that the
# certicate has the correct key usage set.
# This is an important precaution to protect against
# a potential attack discussed here:

# If a tls-auth key is used on the server
# then every client must also have the key.

# Select a cryptographic cipher.
# If the cipher option is used on the server
# then you must also specify it here.

# Enable compression on the VPN link.
# Don't enable this unless it is also
# enabled in the server config file.

# Set log file verbosity.

# Call script that updates DNS settings are
# pushed by the OpenVPN server. It updates your
# /etc/resolv.conf with DNS settings that come
# from the received push dhcp-options. Since
# network management is out of OpenVPN client
#  scope, this script adds and removes the
# provided from those settings.
