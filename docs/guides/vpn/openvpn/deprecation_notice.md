!!! warning "OpenVPN is no longer recommended"
    We do no longer recommending the use of OpenVPN for new deployments. Although OpenVPN has served us well in the past, we believe it's time to move towards more modern and efficient solutions.

    We suggest that users now turn their attention to [WireGuard](../wireguard/overview.md), a forward-thinking VPN solution that offers better performance, faster speeds, and easier implementation. WireGuard has been designed with the latest technology in mind, providing simple yet powerful tools for securing your network communications. Pi-hole's step-by-step tutorial is designed to help you understand the ins and outs of WireGuard, regardless of your technical expertise.
