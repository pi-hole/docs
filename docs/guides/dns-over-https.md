### Why use DNS-Over-HTTPS?

DNS-Over-HTTPS is a protocol for performing DNS lookups via the same protocol you use to browse the web securely: **HTTPS**.

With standard DNS, requests are sent in plain-text, with no method to detect tampering or misbehavior. This means that not only can a malicious actor look at all the DNS requests you are making (and therefore what websites you are visiting), they can also tamper with the response and redirect your device to resources in their control (such as a fake login page for internet banking).

DNS-Over-HTTPS prevents this by using standard HTTPS requests to retrieve DNS information. This means that the connection from the device to the DNS server is secure and can not easily be snooped, monitored, tampered with or blocked.
It is worth noting, however, that the upstream DNS-Over-HTTPS provider will still have this ability.

## Configuring DNS-Over-HTTPS

Along with releasing their DNS service [1.1.1.1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/), Cloudflare implemented DNS-Over-HTTPS proxy functionality into one of their tools: `cloudflared`.

In the following sections, we will be covering how to install and configure this tool on `Pi-hole`.

### Installing `cloudflared`

The installation is fairly straightforward, however, be aware of what architecture you are installing on (`amd64` or `arm`).

#### AMD64 architecture (most devices)

Download the installer package, then use `apt-get` to install the package along with any dependencies. Proceed to run the binary with the `-v` flag to check it is all working:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install ./cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
cloudflared -v

# For CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.rpm
sudo yum install ./cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.rpm
cloudflared -v
```

**Note:** Binaries for other operating systems can be found here: <https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/downloads/>

#### ARM architecture (Raspberry Pi)

Here we are downloading the precompiled binary and copying it to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory to allow execution by the cloudflared user. Proceed to run the binary with the `-v` flag to check it is all working:

```bash
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-arm.tgz
tar -xvzf cloudflared-stable-linux-arm.tgz
sudo cp ./cloudflared /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
cloudflared -v
```

### Configuring `cloudflared` to run on startup

#### Manual way

Create a `cloudflared` user to run the daemon:

```bash
sudo useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin -r -M cloudflared
```

Proceed to create a configuration file for `cloudflared` by copying the following in to `/etc/default/cloudflared`. This file contains the command-line options that get passed to cloudflared on startup:

```bash
# Commandline args for cloudflared
CLOUDFLARED_OPTS=--port 5053 --upstream https://1.1.1.1/dns-query --upstream https://1.0.0.1/dns-query
```

Update the permissions for the configuration file and `cloudflared` binary to allow access for the cloudflared user:

```bash
sudo chown cloudflared:cloudflared /etc/default/cloudflared
sudo chown cloudflared:cloudflared /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
```

Then create the `systemd` script by copying the following into `/etc/systemd/system/cloudflared.service`. This will control the running of the service and allow it to run on startup:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=cloudflared DNS over HTTPS proxy
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=cloudflared
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/cloudflared
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cloudflared proxy-dns $CLOUDFLARED_OPTS
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable the `systemd` service to run on startup, then start the service and check its status:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```

#### Automatic way

<!-- markdownlint-disable code-block-style -->
!!! warning
    Keep in mind that this will install `cloudflared` as root.
<!-- markdownlint-enable code-block-style -->

Proceed to create a configuration file for `cloudflared` in `/etc/cloudflared` named `config.yml`:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/cloudflared/
sudo nano /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
```

Copy the following configuration:

```yaml
proxy-dns: true
proxy-dns-port: 5053
proxy-dns-upstream:
  - https://1.1.1.1/dns-query
  - https://1.0.0.1/dns-query
```

Now install the service via `cloudflared`'s [service command](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/reference/arguments/#service-command):

```bash
sudo cloudflared service install
```

Start the `systemd` service and check its status:

```bash
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```

Now test that it is working! Run the following `dig` command, a response should be returned similar to the one below:

```text

```

### Configuring Pi-hole

Finally, configure Pi-hole to use the local `cloudflared` service as the upstream DNS server by specifying `127.0.0.1#5053` as the Custom DNS:

(don't forget to hit Return or click on `Save`)

### Updating `cloudflared`

#### Manual way

```bash
# stop the service
sudo systemctl stop cloudflared
# fetch and copy the latest version
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-arm.tgz
tar -xvzf cloudflared-stable-linux-arm.tgz
sudo cp ./cloudflared /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
# verify the service is working fine
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```

#### Automatic way

```bash
sudo cloudflared update
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```

### Uninstalling `cloudflared`

#### If installed the manual way

*Courtesy of <https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/uninstall-cloudflare/21459/3>*

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cloudflared
sudo systemctl disable cloudflared
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo deluser cloudflared
sudo rm /etc/default/cloudflared
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared.service
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
```

#### If installed with `cloudflare service install`

```bash
sudo cloudflared service uninstall
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

After the above, don't forget to change the DNS back to something else in Pi-hole's DNS settings!
