### Updating a regular Installation

Updating is as simple as running the following command:

`pihole -up`

!!! tip "Always Read The Release Notes!"
    Ensure you read the release notes for all Pi-hole components. This will help you avoid common problems due to known issues with upgrading or newly required arguments. The Release notes can be found in the Respective Repository for [Core](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/releases), [FTL](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/releases) and [Web](https://github.com/pi-hole/web/releases). This is especially recommended for major updates like `v5 -> v6`.
