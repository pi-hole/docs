!!! warning "Always Read The Release Notes!"
    Ensure you read the release notes for all Pi-hole components. This will help you avoid common problems due to known issues with upgrading or newly required arguments. The release notes can be found in the respective repository for [Core](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/releases), [FTL](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/releases) and [Web](https://github.com/pi-hole/web/releases). This is especially recommended for major updates like `v5 -> v6`. Some updates are accompanied by a post on the [Pi-hole Blog](https://pi-hole.net/landing/blog/) mentioning notable changes.
