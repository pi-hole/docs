!!! info
    [Piping to `bash` is a controversial topic](https://pi-hole.net/2016/07/25/curling-and-piping-to-bash/), as it prevents you from [reading code that is about to run](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh) on your system.

    If you would prefer to review the code before installation, we provide these alternative installation methods.
