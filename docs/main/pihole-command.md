### Core Script

| | |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | `pihole --help` |
| Script Location | [`/usr/local/bin/pihole`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/pihole) |
| Example Usage   | `pihole -b advertiser.example.com` |

The core script of Pi-hole provides the ability to tie many DNS related functions into a simple and user-friendly management system, so that one may easily block unwanted content such as advertisements. For both the Command-line Interface (CLI) and Web Interface, we achieve this through the `pihole` command (this helps minimize code duplication, and allows users to read exactly what's happening using `bash` scripting). This "wrapper" elevates the current user (whether it be your own user account, or `www-data`) using `sudo`, but restricts the elevation to solely what can be called through the wrapper.

### Whitelisting, Blacklisting and Regex

|  | |
|  -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | `pihole -w --help`, `pihole -b --help`, `pihole --regex --help`, `pihole --wild --help` |
| Script Location | [`/opt/pihole/list.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/list.sh) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole --regex '^example.com$' '.*\.example2.net'`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#white-black-list) |

Administrators need to be able to manually add and remove domains for various purposes, and these commands serve that purpose.

See [Regex Blocking](../regex/overview.md) for more information about using Regex.

**Basic Script Process**:

* Each domain is validated using regex (except when using `--regex`), to ensure invalid domains and IDNs are not added
* A domain gets added to or removed from the `domainlist` table in [`/etc/pihole/gravity.db`](../database/gravity/index.md)
* The DNS server is then reloaded

### Debugger

| | |
|  -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | N/A |
| Script Location | [`/opt/pihole/piholeDebug.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/piholeDebug.sh) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole debug`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#debug) |

The Pi-hole debugger will attempt to diagnose any issues, and link to an FAQ with instructions as to how an admin can rectify the issue. Once the debugger has finished, the admin has the option to upload the generated log to the Pi-hole developers, who can help with diagnosing and rectifying persistent issues.

### Log Flush

| | |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | N/A |
| Script Location | [`/opt/pihole/piholeLogFlush.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/piholeLogFlush.sh) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole flush`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#flushing-the-log) |

When invoked manually, this command will allow you to empty Pi-hole's log, which is located at `/var/log/pihole/pihole.log`. The command also serves to rotate the log daily, if the `logrotate` application is installed.

### Reconfigure

| | |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | N/A |
| Script Location | [`/etc/.pihole/automated install/basic-install.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh) |
| Example Usage   | `pihole reconfigure` |

There are times where the administrator will need to repair or reconfigure the Pi-hole installation, which is performed via this command.

**Basic Script Process**:

* [`basic-install.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh) will be run
    * **Reconfigure** will run through the first-time installation prompts, asking for upstream DNS provider, IP protocols, etc
    * **Repair** will retain your existing settings and will attempt to repair any scripts or dependencies as necessary
* The rest of `basic-install.sh` will then run as appropriate

### Tail

| | |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | N/A |
| Script Location | [`/usr/local/bin/pihole`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/pihole) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole tail`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#tailing-the-log) |

Since Pi-hole will log DNS queries by default, using this command to watch the log in real-time can be useful for debugging a problematic site, or even just for sheer curiosities sake.

### Gravity

| | |
| | -------------- |
| Help Command    | N/A |
| Script Location | [`/opt/pihole/gravity.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/gravity.sh) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole -g`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#gravity) |

Gravity is one of the most important scripts of Pi-hole. Its main purpose is to retrieve blocklists, and then consolidate them into one unique list for the built-in DNS server to use, but it also serves to complete the process of manual whitelisting, blacklisting and wildcard update. It is run automatically each week, but it can be invoked manually at any time.

**Basic Script Process**:

* It will determine Internet connectivity, and give time for `pihole-FTL` to be resolvable on low-end systems if has just been restarted
* It extracts all URLs and domains from the `adlists` table in [`/etc/pihole/gravity.db`](../database/gravity/index.md)
* It runs through each URL, downloading it if necessary
    * `curl` checks the servers `Last-Modified` header to ensure it is getting a newer version
* It will attempt to parse the file into a domains-only format if necessary
* Lists are merged, comments removed, sorted uniquely and stored in the `gravity` table of [`/etc/pihole/gravity.db`](../database/gravity/index.md)
* Gravity cleans up temporary content and reloads the DNS server

### Logging

| | |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | `pihole logging --help` |
| Script Location | [`/usr/local/bin/pihole`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/pihole) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole logging off`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#logging) |

This command specifies whether the Pi-hole log should be used, by commenting out `log-queries` within `/etc/dnsmasq.d/01-pihole.conf` and flushing the log.

### Query

| | |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Help Command    | `pihole query --help` |
| Script Location | [`/usr/local/bin/pihole`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/pihole) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole -q -exact -adlist example.domain.com`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#adlist-query) |

This command will query your whitelist, blacklist, wildcards and adlists for a specified domain.

**Basic Script Process**:

* User-specified options are handled
* Using `idn`, it will convert [Internationalized domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name) into [punycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode)
* Database at [`/etc/pihole/gravity.db`](../database/gravity/index.md) is queried to return a list of adlists in which the queried domain exists.

### Update

| | |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | `pihole updatePihole` |
| Script Location | [`/opt/pihole/update.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/update.sh) |
| Example Usage   | `pihole -up` |

Check Pi-hole Core, Web Interface and FTL repositories to determine what upgrades (if any) are required. It will then automatically update and reinstall if necessary.

**Basic Script Process**:

* Script determines if updates are available by querying GitHub
* Updated files are downloaded to the local filesystem using `git`
* [`basic-install.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh) is run

### Version

| | |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Help Command    | `pihole version` |
| Script Location | [`/opt/pihole/version.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/version.sh) |
| Example Usage   | `pihole -v -c` |

Shows installed versions of Pi-hole, Web Interface & FTL. It also provides options to configure which details will be printed, such as the current version, latest version, hash and subsystem.

### Uninstall

| | |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Help Command    | N/A |
| Script Location | [`/etc/.pihole/automated install/uninstall.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/uninstall.sh) |
| Example Usage   | [`pihole uninstall`](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738#uninstall) |
