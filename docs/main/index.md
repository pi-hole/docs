Before installing Pi-hole, you need to make sure your system meets the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) (hardware and operating system) and decide whether you want a [normal installation](basic-install.md) (bare metal) or a [docker installation](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/).

After the installation is complete, check the [Post-Install steps](post-install.md) to make sure your network is using Pi-hole.

With the [`pihole` command](pihole-command.md), you can manually run Pi-hole commands, including [update Pi-hole](update.md).

Alternatively, you can also use the [web interface](https://github.com/pi-hole/web/) to run and configure your Pi-hole.

The web interface also allows you to use [Group Management](../group_management/index.md) functions to manage the relationship between clients, blocking rules, and allowing rules.
