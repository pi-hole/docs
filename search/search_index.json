Via this VPN you cannot only access your admin interface remotely, but also use the DNS server and hence the full filtering capabilities of your Pi-hole from everywhere around the globe. Another plus is that your internet traffic will always be fully encrypted, so surfing on an unencrypted WiFi (like on airports or hotels) becomes a significant boost in terms of security.\n\n\nIf you don't want a full-tunnel, we provide a wiki of how to set up your server to exclusively route DNS traffic, but nothing else via the VPN.\n\n\nOn another optional page, we describe how to set up Pi-hole + VPN in such a way that it is usable both locally (no VPN) and from remote (through VPN) while preserving full functionality.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Information\n\n\nFor security purposes, it is recommended that the CA machine should be separate from the machine running OpenVPN. If you loose control of your CA private key, you can no longer trust any certificates from this CA. Anyone with access to this CA private key can sign new certificates without your knowledge, which then can connect to your OpenVPN server without needing to modify anything on the VPN server. Place your CA files on a storage which can be offline as much as possible, only to be activated when you need to get a new certificate for a client or server.",
